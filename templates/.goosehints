# Context (templates/)
Server renders a minimal HTML shell and injects runtime config for the SPA.

## Key behavior
- `index.html` receives `AppsJSON` from the server, which becomes `window.CONFIG.apps`.
- The rest of the UI is served from embedded static assets under `/static/`.

## Rule
- Do not edit `/static/` by hand; it is bundled output from `frontend/`.
