# Context (frontend/src/)
The frontend is intentionally a thin view over server state.

## State model
- Zustand store is the main state container (`useJobStore`).
- Server is the source of truth; the UI mostly merges in server job snapshots.

## WebSocket protocol (high level)
- `/ws/state` emits:
  - `{ type: "job_snapshot", job, updated_at }` => update one job
  - `{ type: "job_log", job_id, lines }` => stream terminal delta lines

## Performance decisions
- Logs are stored outside React state (`logBuffers`) to avoid rerender pressure.
- Job logs are fetched lazily on selection, and refreshed if the job is running.

## Styling
- Follow `frontend/.goosehints` (Mini Framework + theming + goober). Don’t add utility-class soup.
