# Context (internal/chars/)
Centralized special characters & ANSI constants to avoid literal-newline and escape-sequence issues in Go source.

## Rule
- If you need special chars / newlines / ANSI bytes in Go strings, add them here and reference them.
- Avoid embedding literal newlines in Go strings when possible; prefer `chars.NewLine` / `chars.CRLF`.
