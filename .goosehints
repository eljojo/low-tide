# Context
README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md are full of context about this project, they're good reads if you want to gather context.

# Rules
NEVER load up files from /static/ into your context, it only includes the bundled files from /frontend/.
NEVER run the built project binary yourself (i.e `go run`), ask human to do it. BEFORE confirming a bugfix, ALWAYS do a `make build` to ensure things build correctly.
NEVER delete files without confirming with human first. every single time.

# Makefile Commands
- `make build`: Bundles the frontend assets and builds the Go binary. Use this to ensure the project compiles correctly.
- `make test`: Runs only the Go integration tests. Faster way to check backend logic.
- `make test-e2e`: Builds the project and runs Playwright end-to-end tests. Use this to verify the full user flow. It takes a while to run, use sparingly.
- `make test-all`: Runs both backend and frontend E2E tests. Also builds the application. Use this for a full verification. It takes a while.
- `make run`: Bundles the frontend and starts the Go server. NEVER run this directly, ask human to do it.

When working on the project, it's important to run tests and keep them up to date. If you want, you can run the individual test commands directly (ie `go test`, `npx playwright test`, etc), but using these make commands at the end of operations before telling a human things are done is good practice.

# Pitfalls to avoid
## Note on special characters
When dealing with special characters/text literals in code, store them in internal/chars/chars.go, and be EXTRA careful when handling that file.
For example: `summaryLine := chars.NewLine + fmt.Sprintf`...

# As the project evolves
**Keep `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and all `.goosehints` up to date when major architectural/product direction changes happen** (not for small additions).
