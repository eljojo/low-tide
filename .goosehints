# Context
README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md are full of context about this project, they're good reads if you want to gather context.

# Rules
NEVER load up files from /static/ into your context, it only includes the bundled files from /frontend/.
NEVER run the built project binary yourself (i.e `go run`), ask human to do it. BEFORE confirming a bugfix, ALWAYS do a `make build` to ensure things build correctly.
NEVER delete files without confirming with human first. every single time.
WHEN NECESSARY run `make test` to ensure tests pass. When refactoring, ALWAYS ensure tests pass before considering done. Keep tests up to date with code changes.

# Pitfalls to avoid
## Note on special characters
When dealing with special characters/text literals in code, store them in internal/chars/chars.go, and be EXTRA careful when handling that file.
For example: `summaryLine := chars.NewLine + fmt.Sprintf`...

# As the project evolves
**Keep `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and all `.goosehints` up to date when major architectural/product direction changes happen** (not for small additions).
